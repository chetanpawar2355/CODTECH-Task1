## Overview

This is a simple Java calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two input numbers. The program uses the `Scanner` class for user input and handles basic error scenarios like division by zero.

---

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Division by Zero Handling**: If a user attempts to divide by zero, the program will prompt for a new non-zero divisor.
- **Operator Validation**: The program checks for invalid operators and displays a corresponding error message.
